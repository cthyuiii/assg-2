Link:https://cthyuiii.github.io/assg-2/

PokeDex Web Application allows users to search for any of the 898 Pokemon that currently exists in the PokeAPI database.

It provides and projects details such as pokemon evolution, typing, abilties and more.

User-Friendly and easy to use. Pokemon Sprites are also presented.
 
## Design Process
 
Since this website is mostly catered to young people, gamers or Pokemon fanatics, I already intended to make it as simple as possible with not much
details flying everywhere.

The colours I used are quite similar to the original PokeDex colours in the game of an orangy red colour

I included a search bar as well as simple clickable cards for user to view Pokemon

From a user's perspective, viewing the details of a Pokemon should be simple and easy. Hence, just search and click!

I lastly figured the most minamalistic look was to just go with a grid displaying all the Pokemon in order.

## Features

Search Bar Feature at the top, allows users to search pokemon while it constantly filters out search results.

All 898 Pokemon displayed in order.

Pokemon 'Cards' contained to be clicked and display more infomation about the Pokemon.
 

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

Html Code used to implement the classes to later display the data.

CSS Code used to add style and colour to the elements.

JS used to properly fetch my data from API as well as other functions such as search bar functions.

Main API from :https://pokeapi.co/ 

Google Fonts for fonts.
